  description: "Have you ever worked with a consultant and at the end of the engagement just got a long, double spaced report and a To-Do List? I remember that moment vividly while running my first business. All I could think of was: <i> As a sole-founder, I already have an endless To-Do list. I don't need you to add to it. I need you to tick things off it.</i>"

  title: "Hi I'm Cristina"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    I started Trujion to help founders scale their business by plugging in the gap they have in their team. Being a former start-up founder, mentor and start-up accelerator co-founder I know how hard it is to run a business. The pressure to deliver, the lack of resources, the to-do list never shrinking give me the motivation to work with companies on their most pressing challenges. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
     I believe in helping founders grow and scale their business by assisting with those under-resourced tasks and ideas: being the additional co-founder you wish you had.
